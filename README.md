# Rubiks

## what
This app is designed by Louis Patterson to assist with Rubiks competition training. Essentially it's a timer app that keeps track of cubes, times and users.

## why its fun
The master branch is framework-free. Call it my response to "framework fatigue" but I thought it would be fun to just use ES6 (Babelified) and see how far it goes. The one cheat is an ajax lib but it's on the todo.

I would also like to add future branches for React and Angular versions of the same app.

## todo
- add tests
- move persistant data out of txt files
- replace reqwest with basic XHR module
